Command line for the win

Here are the steps to follow:

I took screenshots of the completed levels.
I opened a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.
i used the SFTP command-line tool to establish a connection (I used ssh) to the sandbox environment. You will need the hostname, username, and password provided to you for the sandbox environment.
Once connected, I navigated to the directory where I want to upload the screenshots.
I used the SFTP put command to upload the screenshots from your local machine to the sandbox environment.
I confirmed that the screenshots have been successfully transferred by checking the sandbox directory.
Once the screenshots are transferred, I proceed to push the screenshots to GitHub.
